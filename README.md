# CS260Startup

Getting to build the entire web application was really helpful. Getting to better understand the way endpoints work in relationship with the browser and the database made it so much easier to get information from the database to the browser. It was also really nice to get to get a better understanding of what was actually happening with a request. Understanding how the body of the request was formatted made it a lot easier to get parameters for the database to the functions from the browser. Also, it was very satisfying to get the endpoints connected with the database and then have my database update. I also get a much better understanding of some of the things you can do with Javascript, just because I had to work with it more to get everything set up. I've taken some web technology classes before, but this assignment helped a lot of different topics, such as node.js and https requests make a lot more sense. 

# Final Review

Port 80 is reserved for HTTP   
HTTP 300 status codes are for redirecting and caching   
HTTP 400 status codes are for user error
HTTP 500 status codes are for server side errors
LANGUAGE is not a standard HTTP header. Some standard headers include Content-type, Host, and cookie.   
Cookies allow the server to store data on the client.      
Web sockets allows for peer to peer communication instead of client to server.    
The purpose of JSX is to inject HTML into Javascript, componentize HTML, and allow for composability of HTML.    
Using the command "NPM install ws" will lock the version of the websocket package for the application, add the websocket source code to the node_modules directory, and adds a dependency to your package.json file.    
It is true that you can use fetch in front end and back end code.    
A linux daemon can execute independent of a user, starts when the computer os rebooted, PM2 is an example of a daemon, and can fork other processes.
